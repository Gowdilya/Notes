At Rangle I worked as a software consultant specializing in Front-End development using JavaScript & TypeScript. Here I had the opportunity to learn and work on several projects for various clients using mainly React with TypeScript(sometimes Vue, and Angular). Also Worked with headless cms such as contentful, and Directus. Continuing to learn and stay on top of emerging technologies such as Next.js. Applied best practices creating responsive UI to match figma designs, unit testing in Jest, and using storybook to isolate components, ensuring accessibility(meeting a11y criteria), and testing with BrowserStack to ensure compatibility across various devices and browsers.
