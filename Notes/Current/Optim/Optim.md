## 2. Can you use Next JS with Redux?

Yes, it is possible to use Next JS with Redux.

### 4. Mention the benefits of implementing a serverless model.

It helps in splitting the app into smaller parts called lambdas. Hence, it helps in improving the readability as well as scalability of any app. The affordability is also enhanced due to the model- "pay for what you use."

### 5. What do you mean by SSR?

This is server-side rendering. This enables rendering on the server a client-side page app, and then we can send that rendered page to that client. These pages get loaded faster as the browser gets access to them sooner.

### 8. What do you mean by automatic code-splitting?

Each page bundles as well as serves every import declared by us. And therefore, unnecessary code is never loaded on the pages.

### 9. Is Next JS backend, frontend, or full-stack?

Next JS is full-stack. This means that it allows rendering client-side as well as server-side content. And this is the reason it is highly valued on React, as React allows only frontend development without it.
