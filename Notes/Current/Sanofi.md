The following is the info I was told to pass over to you for your first interview:

- There will be technical questions but likely only 30 min interview
- There wouldn’t be a coding test , more so scenario based type questions
- Show up 5 minutes before the interview time starts
- Remember the S.T.A.R. method when answering questions:

- **S** – Situation (Describe the situation)
- **T** – Technique (What approach did you use)
- **A** – Action (What action did you take)
- **R** – Result (What was the result of your action)

S- Company was using a lot of resources to build subpar tools for various clients.
Inconsistencies in UI/aesthetics, and often had bugs

T- Careful attention to the foundation. Built clean software one brick at a time. This modular approach was revolutionary to the department. Used Redux etc...

A- Built the Coaching App, Re-use and refine, instead of rebuild.

R- One product- a super app, prevented waste of resources

# Rangle

S- Lack of Knowledge, and high dependency on Solution Architect. We had Documentation but was confusing to use.
