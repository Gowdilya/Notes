Main difference between ODM (mongoose) and ORM (sequelize)

The main difference between both database mappers is that **Sequelize uses promises and Mongoose does not**. Promises are easy to handle with asynchronous events


**ORM is best suited for relational databases, while ODM is best suited for document-based databases**.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and Object-Document Mapping (ODM) are two popular techniques used to interact with databases in a programming language. Both ORM and ODM provide an abstraction layer that allows developers to work with the database using their programming language's objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries. This makes it easier to write, maintain, and test the code. However, there are some key differences between ORM and ODM, and it's important to understand these differences to choose the right approach for your project.

As the name suggests, is used to interact with relational databases. Relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, store data in tables, with each table representing a specific entity and each row representing an instance of that entity. The relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys. ORM provides a way to map these tables and relationships to objects in the programming language, making it easy to work with the data using the familiar object-oriented paradigm. For example, using an ORM library such as Hibernate, a Java developer can define a class to represent a "Person" entity, and Hibernate will automatically create the corresponding table in the database and handle all the CRUD operations.

On the other hand, is used to interact with document-based databases, such as MongoDB and CouchDB. Document-based databases store data in the form of documents, with each document representing an instance of an entity. These databases are more flexible than relational databases, as the structure of the documents can vary from one document to another. ODM provides a way to map these documents to objects in the programming language, making it easy to work with the data using the familiar object-oriented paradigm. For example, using an ODM library such as Mongoose, a JavaScript developer can define a schema to represent a "Person" entity, and Mongoose will automatically handle all the CRUD operations.

So, when should you use ORM, and when should you use ODM? The main difference between ORM and ODM is the type of database they are used with. If you are working with a **relational database**, **ORM** is the way to go. ORM is more **powerful and flexible** than ODM, as it can handle complex relationships between tables. However, if you are working with a **document-based database**, **ODM** is the better choice. ODM is simpler and more suited for document-based databases, as it is designed to work with the flexible schema of these databases.

It's also important to note that there are other types of databases like Graph databases and Time series databases, which have their ORM or ODM libraries specific to them. For example, Neo4j uses Cypher as the query language and has its own ORM library called "Neo4j-OGM" (Object Graph Mapping) and InfluxDB uses InfluxQL and has its own ORM library called "InfluxDB-ORM".

In conclusion, ORM and ODM are powerful techniques that allow developers to work with databases more efficiently and conveniently. ORM is best suited for relational databases, while ODM is best suited for document-based databases. However, the choice of which to use ultimately depends on the specific needs of your project and the type of database you are working with.
