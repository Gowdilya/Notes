When working the StarRating QuestionType Epic one of the issues we ran into was a lack of specs from design. We dealt with this by moving forward as much as I can basing off what we had in production(older version of the question type), and completing all functionality and adding improvements to the best of my knowledge. We kept the components very modular and followed [[SOLID principle]].

	- to fast track new onboarding members
	- trouble shoot common issues
	- document setup and commonly used process

- created survey question type:
