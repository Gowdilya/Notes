DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation is used to make web pages dynamic and interactive with the help of HTML updates in the web application. However, it takes more time to update the DOM and results in a number of unnecessary updates by many [JavaScript frameworks](https://anywhere.epam.com/en/blog/top-5-javascript-frameworks). Note that a single DOM update makes only a small change on a webpage.

In its turn, React tries to optimize the process by updating only the parts of the DOM that are actually updated each time. This optimization is carried out by tracking a lightweight “Virtual DOM Object” and updating the changes accordingly.

React identifies the exact changed objects by using Virtual DOM snapshots, so it updates only the necessary objects rather than creating a new DOM every time.

This whole optimization process significantly reduces the web application load time, thereby making it more efficient.
