## Use Desktop App not Web app for localhost
Postman Website **cannot** send a request to your computer's localhost. It first _needs_ to connect to your PC with the Postman desktop client. You can download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Run it, then go to the Postman workspace in your browser -> send the request and it will work.
