A URL, or [Uniform Resource Locator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL), is essentially the address of another computer, or "server" on the internet. Part of the URL specifies how to reach the server, and part of it tells the server what information we want - but more on that later.
