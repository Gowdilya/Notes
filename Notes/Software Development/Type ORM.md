TypeORM supports both [Active Record](https://typeorm.io/active-record-data-mapper#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](https://typeorm.io/active-record-data-mapper#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns, unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence, which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable, maintainable applications the most productive way.
