Observables are an essential concept in RxJS. The foundation of Observables lies in two software design patterns:

- The Observer pattern
- The Iterator pattern

Ideally, RxJS combines the Observer pattern with the Iterator pattern and functional programming with collections to fill the ideal way of managing sequences of events. So, it is not wrong to say that Observables in RxJS are a merger of observer and iterator software patterns.![[Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 11.28.34 PM.png]]
