#JavaScript 
A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


```js
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

`init()` creates a local variable called `name` and a function called `displayName()`. The `displayName()` function is an inner function that is defined inside `init()` and is available only within the body of the `init()` function. Note that the `displayName()` function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, `displayName()` can access the variable `name` declared in the parent function, `init()`.

# scope
Traditionally (before ES6), JavaScript only had two kinds of scopes: _function scope_ and _global scope_. Variables declared with `var` are either function-scoped or global-scoped, depending on whether they are declared within a function or outside a function. This can be tricky, because blocks with curly braces do not create scopes:
