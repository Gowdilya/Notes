Every engineer/developer worth considering should be familiar with unit testing. Asking this question will give you an understanding of their attitude toward it, and what level of priority they give it in their working process. Do they follow test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD), or are unit tests something they tack on afterward for the sake of process conformance or mere appearances?

Typically regarded by most industry professionals as being a best practice in code maintenance and software development, unit tests are usually part of an overall testing strategy. They test for logic errors and coding flaws, helping to prevent bugs from advancing to the finished product. Plus, because they’re automated, they prevent _regressions_, where bugs return that had already been fixed.
