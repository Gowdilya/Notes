If your application is sensitive to latency (the delay between a request for data and the response), choose a Region that is close to your user base. This helps prevent long wait times for your customers. Synchronous applications such as gaming, telephony, WebSockets, and Internet of Things (IoT) are significantly affected by high latency. Asynchronous workloads, such as ecommerce applications, can also suffer from user connectivity delays.
