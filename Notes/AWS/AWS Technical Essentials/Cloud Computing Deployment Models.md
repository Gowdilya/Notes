## On-premises

companies maintained hardware: compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers and allocated entire infrastructure department  to take care of the data centers

costly operation that made some workloads and experiements impossible.

As internet use became more widespread, the demand for compute, storage, and networking equipment increased. For some companies and organizations, 

the cost of maintaining a large physical presence was unsustainable. To solve this problem, cloud computing emerged.

## Cloud

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of IT resources over the internet with primarily **pay-as-you-go** pricing. 

With cloud computing, companies do not have to manage and maintain their own hardware and data centers. Instead, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) own and maintain data centers and provide virtual data center technologies and services to companies and users over the internet.


## Hybrid

A third option is a hybrid deployment. This type of deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure into the cloud.


## On-premise vs Cloud
![[On-premises_vs_Cloud.PNG]]
To help differentiate between running workloads on premises and in the cloud, consider a scenario in which developers must deploy a new application feature. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the same configurations as production. ==In an on-premises solution, an additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. These tasks can be time consuming and expensive. Meanwhile, the new feature’s time-to-market increases while the developers wait for the QA environment.== 

In contrast, by running your application in the cloud, ==you can replicate an entire production environment in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, the solution is managed over the internet.==
