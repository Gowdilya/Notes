## Pay as you go

Â paying only for the resources that you use in contrast to on-premises models of investing in data centers and hardware that might not be fully used.

## Benefit of massive economies of scale

You can achieve ==a lower cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud==, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

## Stop guessing capacity

Stop guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. ==You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.==

## Increase speed and agility
==IT resources are only a click away==, which means that you reduce the time to make resources available to developers from weeks to minutes. This results in a ==dramatic increase in agility for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop== is significantly lower.

## Realize cost savings
Companies can focus on projects that differentiate their business and ==remove the "undifferentiated heavy lifting",== instead of maintaining data centers. With cloud computing, you can focus on your customers, rather than racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure.

## Go global in minutes

Applications can be ==deployed in multiple Regions around the world with a few clicks. This means that you can provide lower latency== and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.
