OOP has been a standard convention for over 20 years and is organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. It is ever-present and it is very unlikely a candidate would not have run into it at some point.

Here are ten examples of terms they should be able to define:

- class, object (and the difference between the two)
- method (as opposed to, say, a C function)
- virtual method, pure virtual method
- class/static method
- static/class initializer
- constructor
- destructor/finalizer
- superclass or base class
- subclass or derived class

_NB. Some firms avoid OOP and prefer to use a functional programming (FP) language such asÂ **Clojure**._
